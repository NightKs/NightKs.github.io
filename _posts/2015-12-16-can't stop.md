#Holy 

Oh I cant stop thinking about   
All of these feelings and all of these routes   
I cant stop thinking about    
All of these feelings oh I'm filled with doubts   
Someone once told me    
I'm not the only,   
One who's not Holy    
Someone once told me
Life's never easy   
Everybody sins in their own way   
Oh I cant stop thinking about 
All of these feelings and all of these routes 
I cant stop thinking about  
All of these feelings oh I'm filled with doubts 
The devil came to me 
He said I'll keep you better, 
Better company 
I said I wanna take a ride with you 
But don't let me look back 
Oh I cant stop thinking about 
All of these feelings and all of these routes 
I cant stop thinking about 
All of these feelings oh I'm filled with doubts 
Doubts 
show me the right route 
Doubts    
show me the right 
Oh I cant stop thinking about 
All of these feelings and all of these routes 
I cant stop thinking about 
All of these feelings oh I'm filled with doubts
